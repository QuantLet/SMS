Name of Quantlet : SMSclus8pd

Published in : 'Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions'

Description : 'Employs the Ward algorithm using squared Euclidean distance and single linkage method using simple Euclidean distance and squared Euclidean distance matrices to perform a cluster analysis on an 8 points example. Three plots are generated. First plot schows the 8 points, second plot the dendrogram for squared Euclidean distance and single linkage while the third plot presents the dendrogram for Euclidean distance using single linkage algorithm'

Keywords : 'cluster-analysis, dendrogram, Ward algorithm, euclidean, 
distance, linkage'
